# There are two versions. SkMMv2 and SkMMv2_stable are mathematically equivalent, but SkMMv2 should be slightly faster when the sketching dim m is large. There are 3 hyper-parameters in this algorithm:
# sketching dimension m should be slightly larger than but proportional to the intrinsic dimension
# block size b is there mainly for the efficiency sake. When n is small, I usually set b to 1. If the algorithm is too slow, you can increase the block size (Iâ€™ve done 5 or 10).
# temperature: leave it as default unless you see some weird behaviors.
